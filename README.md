Consider the AC circuit . You are tasked to choose a load comprising appropriate passive
elements to be connected in terminals a-b, so that the output current experiences a resonance for
an input frequency of 1kHz. At the same time, you need to ensure that maximum average power
is tranferred to the load at the resonant frequency.To solve the problem, you need to follow a systematic approach, going through the following steps.
(a) Design the circuit through proper calculations based on the basic concepts of AC circuits.
(b) Verify that both the requirements are satisfied through necessary simulations and analyses
using a software tool. Find the average power supplied to the load using software.
